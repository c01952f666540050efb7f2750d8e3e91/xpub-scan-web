# xpub-scan-web

This is just the xpub-scanner except we've added it to a web format such that non-technical users can use this feature.
It takes an xpub - normally one that you'd find in ledger live and provide a history of transactions, UTXOs etc.

PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

## To-do

- install xpub-scan and dependencies
- add search bar for xpub
- add dropdown for supported tokens to search
- add dropdown for specific account types (legacy, segwit, native segwit and taproot)
- add search button
- change the icon
- update css
